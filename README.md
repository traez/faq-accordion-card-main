## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1) DOM manipulation learning never ends. O ti poju! Learnings plenty...too much to mention.  
2) While still mastering best practice, I reckon documenting (and commenting) solutions is tres important in programming. Be it Algorithms or HTML-CSS-JavaScript code for your clones. You'd need the same sequences for multiple tasks, and being able to review your past work saves you time Googling.  

### Continued development

Keep attempting JavaScript projects till I've very comfortable with my level of proficiency.  

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
